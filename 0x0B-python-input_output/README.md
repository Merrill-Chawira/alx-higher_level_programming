Input: 
Input in Python refers to the process of accepting data from the user or an external source and storing it in a variable for further processing. The input() function is commonly used to take user input from the console. When input() is called, the program waits for the user to type something and press Enter. Whatever the user types is then returned as a string and can be stored in a variable for use in the program.

Output:
Output in Python refers to the process of displaying information to the user or writing data to an external destination such as a file or another program. The print() function is commonly used to output data to the console. It takes one or more arguments, converts them to strings if they're not already strings, and displays them on the console.
